## Introduction
ScanSSH is a tool for [OpenSSH](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable). It's made by Python and it has **two** branches(version): [**Full version**](FULL.md) and [**Streamline version**](STREAMLINE.md).

Full version has **SSH Server Scanner for a network segment, SSH Server Scanner for one IP, SSH Server Scanner for all of the devive of LAN, Add device ip to ips group, Remove device ip from ips group, List device from ips group, Connect with IP, Connect with device in ips group**, and more for you to explore

Streamline version only supports **SSH Server Scanner for one IP, Connect device with one IP**. So we recommend you to use Full version. But if you don't like *Every time when I run this program. First, choose what option will I choose. Second, again inputing option for connecting ... I'm dead* You can just choose Streamline version!
